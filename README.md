AI-Powered Log Analyzer

A web-based tool where users can upload large, complex log files (e.g., from Kubernetes, robotics, game servers) and receive AI-powered analysis.

The system automatically identifies anomalies, provides natural-language summaries of errors, and allows users to ask questions about the log data.

Project Goals

Frontend: A clean, responsive React interface for file uploads and displaying analysis reports.

Backend: A scalable FastAPI backend to handle large file uploads and manage the AI analysis pipeline.

AI: Integrate the Gemini API to perform anomaly detection, error summarization, and answer user queries.
